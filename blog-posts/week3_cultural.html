			<p>I would like to start off by saying that even though I took the personal thinking style quiz and arrived at the result of "Abstract Sequential", I cannot fully identify myself with this term. Looking at back at my entire life starting from elementary school up to this point and at the way I was able to see, process, analyze and digest information, I feel that the definition of "Abstract Sequential" is too restrictive for me and doesn't fully reflect my brain's thinking and communicative patterns. With me it's never the same: one day I feel like using a logical approach and working by myself, but then the next day I could as easily be using abstract imagination while collaborating with someone else.</p>
			<p>The word that comes to mind here is flexibility. I truly think that it might just be the biggest trump card up my sleeve. I don't feel the need or desire to place myself within some imaginary boundaries by telling everyone else that my thinking style is "Abstract Sequential" and my learning style is "Multimodal". It may be seen as a good idea to take a test and identify your thinking style, but on the down side, it also automatically creates prejudiced and biased perceptions of oneself in the eyes of his/her teammates. And that could have some unintended effects later on.</p>
			<p>Relating this thought to DBC, I remember that one of the first things we've done was sending introductory emails to the members of our accountability groups, where we had to identify our thinking styles. After seeing what my groupmates wrote, I told myself that I shouldn't jump to any conclusions early on. Now that I've paired up and worked alongside a few of my fellow students, I'm able to better understand them and also adapt my own style to each individual that I have to work with. I think that if everyone would at least try to do that, it would tremendously increase the level of productivity and quality of the learning process.</p>
			<p>This idea directly relates to the concept of "growth mindset" vs. "fixed mindset". I know that many of us, including myself as a matter of fact, must have been somewhat disappointed after reading through that article and realizing that they most likely lean towards the "fixed mindset", while the article strongly suggested that "growth mindset" is an ideal and is the way to go! However, the good news is that we don't have to be discouraged by that. It's OK to be the way you are as long as you are open to ideas and able to adapt. I believe that the article's main point was that you could easily transform a "fixed mindset" into a "growth mindest", that these are just mere terms and not something that's programmed into our genes.</p>
			<p>I was very nervous before my first peer-pairing and guided-pairing sessions during Phase 0. I thought that it was only going to be harder working on something I don't fully understand yet with another person that, chances are, is not an expert either. But as it happened many times before, my illusions and self-created fears have been dispersed once I have actually tried peer-pairing and realized that it could be a lot of fun instead of being something to be afraid of. We all have got to learn to become more like chameleons, but instead of changing colors, we will be changing our brains. Hopefully, that will allow us to achieve success here at DBC!</p>
