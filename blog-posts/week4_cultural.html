			<p>The world of technology today may seem like the biggest virtue of the 21st century. The opportunities that it opens up to the humanity are thrilling and exciting and we can only dream of what's stored for us in the future! Such view is shared by most of modern people. However, there is always a flip side to any coin and tech is no exception. What problems could all these apps with an extremely wide range of functionality possibly present to us?</p>
			<p>Apparently, not everything is so idyllic as we'd like to think it is... Although it was not easy for me to identify a topic for this week's post, after a certain amount of research I decided to focus on the issue of security and trust associated with the technological explosion of our age. Specifically, I am talking about the increasing user resistance against exposing personal data to large tech companies. (Google, Facebook, etc.) Despite the great benefits that many websites and apps present the user with, privacy is something that none of us want to sacrifice.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, today virtually no one can fly under the radar. A lot of tech companies rely more and more on selling user data to increase their revenue. Even though, they try to advertise it as an opportunity to offer better personalized servies, most people are very skeptical about such prospects. Moreover, the recent scandal revolving around the NSA and multiple cases of privacy breach on the domestic as well as foreign level revealed to the world by former government contractor Edward Snowden, has only exacerbated public fears associated with the security of information. It looks like the "Eye of Mordor" is watching all of us now!</p>
			<p>It's certainly not easy to restore trust in the eyes of someone once you've lost it. The same principle applies here: it's going to take the efforts of users, tech companies and government combined together to slowly build up and attempt to restore the same level of assurance that we previously had towards the online spread of data. We also have to keep in mind that it is a global issue as well, so collaboration between different countries is something that will have to be successfully established in order for this thing to work. The tech companies are going to have to empower the users with tools to protect their own privacy while the government will have to do a good job of keeping up with the technological progress in terms of laws and regulations that it creates. As for us, the users, I guess we all have to draw a clear line and become smarter and more aware in regards to what information we want to put out there on the Internet. And let's not forget that it's up to us to put the pressure on tech giants and the government to make sure that our privacy is well protected.</p>
