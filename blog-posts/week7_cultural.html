			<h2>Values in my life</h2>
			<p>Accomplishment (3), Achievement (3), Adventure (2), Close relationships (5), Compassion (4), Confidence (2), Economic security (3), Enthusiasm (2), Faith (4), Free time (5), Honesty (5), Inner harmony (5), Introspection (4), Location (3), Loyalty (5), Nature (4), Order (4), Peace (3), Pleasure (4), Privacy (4), Purity (4), Romance (2), Security (3), Self-respect (2), Serenity (3), Spirituality (4), Stability (3), Tranquility (3), Wisdom (4)</p>
			<h2>Most important value</h2>
			<p>I guess all of the values that I listed above are of great importance to me, but if I were to choose one, I would probably pick "Inner harmony". However, in my view, "Order", "Peace", "Securtiy", "Stability" and "Tranquility" are, if not synonyms, at least closely related to "Inner harmony". Thus, I would group all of these into one definition.</p>
			<p>The reason why this value is so important to me probably has to do with how I percieve life in general. Things like "Accomplishment", "Confidence", "Economic security", etc. are definitely an essential part of happines. But to me, they are simply impossible to attain without having this so-called inner harmony, a state of perfect balance inside one's self. And so far, my experience in life only goes on to prove this. There have been times when I could say that I held some of the values mentioned here, but I was never able to retain them for as long as I wish for. I think that the reason for this is that I was never in a state of complete harmony; there's always been a dissonance inside of my soul to a certain extent. That is why now I focus first and foremost on acheiving the state of perfect balance inside my body and my mind and only after that I will even attempt to collect everything else.</p>
			<h2>Advice</h2>
			<p>The last time someone asked for my advice was actually not that long ago. It took place last week when my good friend had asked me to help him choose between the two potential ways of dispose of rather large sum of money. I won't reveal his secret, of course, but ironically, this issue was directly related to DBC as my friend also decided to enroll! Deep inside I felt honored by the fact that he went to me in search for such an important, potentially life-changing decision for him. I guess it increased my sense of self-worth as well.</p>
			<h2>Values and stereotype threat</h2>
			<p>I think that the values that I've talked about in the previous paragraphs can definitely help me avoid becoming a stereotype threat simply because they represent true meaning in my life as opposed to some fake values that usually result from stereotyping. As long as I keep that in mind, I feel very safe and protected from any kind of stereotype threats. As for the fact that I could potentially start to feel down or lost at DBC, I will be honest - I think that it will inevitably happen at some point. The good part, however, is that I anticipate it and I know how to deal with it. It's not the first time in my life it will happen and certainly won't be the last, but luckily I am now equipped with some powerful tools (when I talked about finding inner harmony, that's precisely what I meant) to combat this dreaded feeling. That is why I believe that this experience for me will be unlike any others in the past!</p>
