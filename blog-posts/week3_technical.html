		<h1>Why JavaScript is the #1!</h1>
		<p>I guess a good place to begin talking about JavaScript would be stating the fact that it's the most poopular programming language in the world. Now, you don't become a world champion for no reason! And with JavaScript there are plenty of reasons why it's the language of choice for many developers and engineers. I'm not going to go through all of them to explain this popularity (as I myself don't have the full understanding of this subject yet), instead I will try to talk in more detail about the few that I see as the most crucial.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Javascript is easy to learn and easy to edit</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Definitely not the least important aspect of JavaScript's greatness is its relative ease. This argument is supported by many experts in the field. JS syntax is rather close to actual English language. Also, JS is a scripting programming language, which means that code written in JS does need to be compiled or translated, so really, all you need to do is just open any text editor of your choice and get going!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>JavaScript is fast!</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Since JavaScript is executed on the client side, meaning that its code is executed on the user's processor rather than on the web server, it's got good execution speed. The great news is that not only is JavaScript fast by itself, but you can also create some JS code in a speedy manner thanks to a great JS libary called jQuery! With the help of jQuery, JavaScript can easily manipulate web pages with just a few lines of code.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>JavaScript is the language of the Web</li>
		</ul>
		<p>It seems like JavaScript and the Internet were made for each other. What's very important is that JS is fully supported by all modern browsers and works great with HTML/DHTML, CSS3, etc. Yes, JavaScript may have been seen as a clumsy language in the past and it may have been associated with browser incompatibility issues, but those times are long gone! Today JS has become a very flexible and widely standardized language; just take a look at the graph below:

		<ul>
			<li>Node.js or V8 JavaScript engine</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Arguably, one of JavaScript's biggest weaknesses is that it's a front end only language, meaning that it's great for things like maipulating web pages and creating User interfaces but when it comes to fetching data from servers, it has to rely on other technologies. However, things are about to change with the introduction of Node.js that is built on Google Chrome's JS Runtime engine V8. This engine is capable of handling server side responsibilities and it implements JavaScripts's huge advantage of being asynchronous. In simple English, it means that JS process multiple tasks at the same time and doesn't need have to do everything in order. This could potentially make the web's future even brighter than it is today!</p>
		<p>Despite all of the above, let us not emerge ourselves in a sense of euphoria about JavaScript. Although they might be overshadowed by its advantages, there are still flaws and limitations to JS. There are a few security issues that could be associated with JavaScript due to the potential of exploiting the user's system by snippets of code added onto web pages that execute immediately. In addition, JavaScript creates issues when used in search engines. Nevertheless, JavaScript has most certainly deserved to be considered the greatest programming language. Now let's see if any other language can overthrow JS from the throne in the future!</p>
