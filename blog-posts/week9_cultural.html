			<p>Asking questions, and more importantly, asking the right questions is obviously a crucial part of any learning process. I can recall so many times when my teachers would say that a student should never be ashamed to ask questions, that there are no stupid questions and that the fact that a student is asking questions indicates that he/she is actively thinking and analyzing new information and is therefore on the right track.</p>
			<p>I for one was never the type that constantly bombarded my professors with questions as soon as I would realize that I'm not understanding something right or I'm falling behind. My initial urge would always be to try and do everything I can to find an answer to my own question. On the other hand, if that didn't work I could never simply let go and forget about the question that arose in my head no matter how unimportant it might have seemed. It would constatnly bug me and once the need to resolve the issue became stronger than the fear of asking the teacher a question in front of the entire class, that's when I knew that there's no other way. I always felt like asking questions too soon during the lecture is really disruptive and I've seen cases where 2-3 students (these were always the same people) would consume a tremendous amount of class time by asking too many questions and not allowing the professor to provide a smooth teaching flow to the entire class continuosly. That's the "bad" side of asking questions.</p>
			<p>However, what I've just talked about mostly applies to a traditional learning environment (usually, a classroom). Posting your questions online is an entirely different thing and luckily, you don't have to worry about affecting anybody else's learning experience by doing that! During Phase 0 I only had to post questions on the Google+ community a couple of times, because normally I would be able to figure out what I needed by conducting an online research (using Google, stackoverflow, etc.). I definitely agree that an ideal question has to be detailed and sharp, preferrably concise and to the point. I try to follow these simple rules every time I'm about to ask a question whether online or in person.</p>
			<p>Of course, with the start of Phase 1 just hours away, I realize that I will have to implement this "asking questions" technique while attending DBC. I'm certainly prepared to keep an open mind and absorb any useful information I can get, that means even when somebody else is asking a question that I might have not thought of. In the end, even people who have substantial knowledge base in any field eventually find themselves in a situation where they have to ask questions, not to mention beginners like myself. That is why I feel that perfecting an art of asking questions the right way should be a focus for all of us!</p>
