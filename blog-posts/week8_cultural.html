			<p>I guess I should start off by saying that I simply hate conflicts of any kind. It might sound trivial but it's true. I feel very anxious when I sense that a conflict between me and someone else or even between two random people that are next to me is about to arise. I'm not a great conflict person and so I try to do everything in my power to avoid it.</p>
			<p>However, I'm not so naive as to not realize that, unfortunately, conflicts are inevitable in our life... Sometimes things just get out of control and even if one party doesn't want to be involved in a conflict but the other does, it's most likely going to happen. Obviously, I'm no saint and throughout the course of my life I was engaged in a conflict with different people including my close friends and relatives. In particular, I want to go back to a time when I was still a teenager and I had a rather serious altercation with my mother. I'll skip the details, of course, but the general picture was that I wanted to go away on a long road trip with my friends and she thought that it was too unsafe and that I was too young to do it at the time.</p>

			<p>Today when I look back at it, I realize that neither of us was right (as is the case with conflicts almost 100% of the time!) and although we both had some valid arguments going for us, the way we expressed them to each other was inappropriate and destructive and instead of resolving our conflict in a peaceful and logical manner, we chose the destructive and hurtful path. In the end, I was left feeling guilty (and I'm sure that she was too!) and frustrated partially because of my lack of ability to defend my point of view and the lack of understanding from my mother, but also, partially because deep inside I knew that she was right in a lot of ways and I simply didn't have the gut to admit it.</p>
			<p>Now, since I became more experienced in dealing with conflicts and my mind has matured, I certainly know how I would approach that situation if I could ever go back in time. Probably, first and most important rule that I've learned is that you have to stay calm and keep your cool no matter what is being said to you and no matter how frustrated you feel inside. Getting angry will never help resolve the conflict or help you prove your point, on the contrary, it will create even more distance between you and your opponent in addition to the fact that it can result in unwanted consequences, including wandering off the main subject of argument and bringing into it things that are completely unrelated, which will only worsen the situation. That's the mistake I've often made in the past, but luckily now I've learned how to control myself and beleive me, I've spared myself and others from a ton of unnecessary stress. I think that if all people could learn this seemingly difficult, but in reality, quite simple technique, it would bring so much more tranquility to this world.</p>
			<p>Another important aspect of conflict is the inability of people to listen to each other. Not physically, of course, but actually comprehend the things that the opposition is trying to deliver to your brain. The key here is to learn how to place yourself inside the other person's shoes for even a minute and thus, look at the conflict from the other side. Ideally, this has to go both ways because even if one party is able to do it while the other can not, a productive resolution of conflict is rarely achieved. I found mastering this skill to be a lot more difficult than the previous one that I've talked about, but hard work will pay off in the end and you will only benefit if you learn how to widen you range of vision towards this world.</p>

			<p>In conclusion, I can only repeat myself again by saying that conflicts are unavoidable. But it doesn't mean that they are unresolvable! A wise person will avoid the conflict but if forcefully involved in a one, he/she will do everything in order to benefit from it and use it to grow as a person and help the opponent do the same. I sincerely hope that at DBC all of us are able to create a productive and stress-free atmosphere by following these simple steps!</p>
