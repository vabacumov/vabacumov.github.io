			<p>Stereotyping is definitely something that each of us must have encountered at some point throughout his/her life. When I say this, I mean that we both were victims of stereotypes and used stereotypes to make a judgment about another person. Even though very few people would admit it, it's probably true...</p>
			<p>Stereotypes are inevitable in some ways. On one hand, they don't come out of nothing: if there's a specific stereotype about a certain ethnic or racial, social or economic group, then chances are, a fair share of the representatives of that group probably must have done something to give birth to that stereotype. On the other hand, obvisouly, it would very silly even to think that it's possible to accomodate all members of a group under any kind of stereotype. We all have our own unique personalities, character traits that make us what we really are and simply belonging to one group or another, either by choice or unwillingly (for example, nationality), doesn't necessarilly mean that we absolutely have to behave a certain way! This is the key concept that needs to be understood in order to dispel the myth of stereotypes.</p>
			<p>Personally, I feel that I too sometimes may be under the risk of being stereotyped. After all, I come from another country and I've only been in U.S. for ten years. When I came here as an adolescent, I encountered people from all over the world and I guess they must have had their own stereotypical beliefs about me just like I had mine about them. Nevertheless, with time I realized that stereotyping is not a reliable tool if you want to make new friends, find out more about different cultures, engage in various communities. Not only did I learn how to get rid of the stereotypes already present in my head, but also, how to brush off the thought of being stereotyped myself. We don't have the ability to get inside someone's head and find out what he/she thinks about us, so why bother trying to predict what stereotypes are running through someone's head when they see you at all? I feel like this is the way to go now and strongly encourage those of you who still aren't able to manage this issue to try and employ this tactic in your everyday life. Believe me, it will take a huge load off your shoulders!</p>
			<p>P.S. And by the way, I hope the image I put at the top doesn't offend anybody! I didn't draw it myself in case you're wondering :)</p>
