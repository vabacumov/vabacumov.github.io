			<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> is by default one of my favorite sites, simply because I do a whole lot of shopping there. It is a very popular website, in general, you can imagine how many people visit it every day, hour, even minute! There isn't a single element, per se, that draws your eye instantly when you visit the homepage, but I could definitely point out a couple of their advertisements located in the center of the screen, since there are a few attractive pictures of the products they sell. To describe Amazon.com visually, I would use words like detailed, scattered, decentralized, voluminous and multifunctional. As most of you know, Amazon sells virtually anything, thus, I think they've done a good job dividing their content into meaningful sections in order to attract more potential customers. Specifically, the wide array of merchandise is split up into categories that make sense, so that the customer will know where to start looking for what he needs. Serious, effective, organized, practical and luring are the adjectives I choose to describe Amazon.com's content and purpose. It is relatively easy to find exactly what you're looking for with a couple clicks of the mouse or by typing characters into a search box that is helpful and smart when it comes to looking up the right product. Thus, I would say that the homepage is crucial for the entire website and it certainly gets the job done by allowing users to browse any content they want to find. Sometimes I would say that I feel overwhelmed after being on the site for a while, but that's only because of the desire to buy so many things that come constantly come up. At least you'll never feel bored on Amazon.com</p>

			<p>My number one sports resource is <a href="http://www.eurosport.ru/">Eurosport</a>. It is probably the website I visit most often apart from Google. It is quite popular and is among leading European online sports newspapers. They change their design pretty often and the latest update has been a big change from what users were used to. The top storyline is the element that immediately grabs your attention when you open the homepage. Eurosport.ru is very colorful, glamorous, striking, diverse, and even sexy. It presents good accessibility when it comes to exploring the content, for example, the header is a drop-down menu filled with blocks containing the names of the most popular sports competitions. It usually takes scrolling through a few pages when you want to look up a certain statistic, for example, so I can definitely see some room for improvement when it comes to accessibility of content. However, Eurosport compensates that by being fun, trendy, up-to-date, engaging and comfortable. There are very few ads that occasionally pop up and the website doesn't sell anything, so this doesn't ruin the overall experience for the user. You might want to make sure that you've got some extra time on hand, before you start digging through the contents of Eurosport.com, because I can tell you from experience that this website is really addictive!</p>

			<p>My last website to discuss is <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, no need to introduce this one, for sure! There isn't too much content on the homepage to catch the user's eye apart from the puzzled sphere image surrounded by the choice of different languages, which as far as I can remember, has been there for a really long time. But this doesn't stop Wikipedia.org from holding a solid fifth place on the most-visited websites list on the entire Web! Their website is reall straight-forward, easy to navigate, "no BS" type of web resource. You know exactly what you're visually going to get from Wikipedia's homepage: humble, clear, old-fashioned, basic and even somewhat boring. But don't let the cover fool you - there's a ton of exciting great content hiding inside! It is easy to find what you need, just go ahead and type your keyword in that searchbox, choose your language and press "Go". Wikipedia's insides are resourceful, informational, strict, stable and useful. It is a one of a kind website that's become the-go-to place for millions or even billions of users worldwide when they need to find out something they don't know. What might be just the greatest thing about Wikipedia is that it's a non-profit organization, thus the website is ad-free, which doesn't distract users' attention while researching important information. I have donated money to Wikipedia in the past and I strongly encourage you to do the same in order to keep this great web database prospering!</p>
