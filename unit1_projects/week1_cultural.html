			<p>I still have a mixed impression on DBC is really like, but after watching "The Fireside Chat", I feel like I'm starting to understand the big picture. Yes, I know that we all have our fears, our own doubts, our motivations, and it's great that DBC encourages us to share them with each other. However, all of the students from out cohort are yet to emerge fully into the atmosphere of this so-called "bootcamp". And until we step into that building located on 633 Folsom Street (for those of you attending in SF!), all we can do is to do our best to prepare ourselves, both technically and culturally.</p>
			<p>The most important thing about this whole business, in my mind, is the fact that we all have gathered here to reach the same goal. I imagine all the students as one big sports team, except that we're not playing against another team, but rather against ourselves - the selves that are filled with doubt, fear, those guys that still hesitate and want to turn back. Together we can not only help each other master the skills of a professional developer, but we can also boost our self-esteem, make a real change in our lives. Most of us have probably already did just that.
			<p>What Shereef mentioned about "Restaurant vs Kitchen" approach makes perfect sense and that's the way it should be! After all, nine weeks really is not that long period of time, thus, we have to make the best use of every hour, every minute that we are going to spend at DBC. It's awesome that the teachers are on the same page with us, students. That could be crucial in determining whether a student will succeed or not. And I feel like at DBC these guys would take the failure of every each and one of us personally, which is exactly why they are going to do their best to help us win! All we have to do is not resist and, in turn, help them!</p>
