			<p>The obvious challenge for this website was to divide the massive content into categories that make sense and also not to draw the user's attention to any specific single element but rather let the user see all the elements at once and then choose exactly what he wants. It is solved by creating an extremely effective sidebar on the left side with a dropdown menu that expands a bigger element containing an image and more content upon hovering with the mouse. In addition, multiple banners are spread out throughout different sections of the webpage, but at the same time no single banner stands out as their sizes are reduced. As for the header, the account buttons and searchbox provide the user an option to quickly jump to the page he wants to see.</p>

			<p>This is supposed to be an engaging and interactive homepage with certain element or multiple elements that stand out at first sight. The interactive part is achieved with the use of the header and medium-sized buttons that allow the user to quickly navigate different subdivisions of the website. On the other hand, if the user doesn't have a specific goal set in mind while visiting the page and simply wants to browse what's available to him, the heavy use of colors and images combined with the informative captions allows to capture the user's mind with the possibility of continously scrolling down until he finds something that is of interest to him.<p/>

			<p>The simplicity of this website may be its biggest virtue. While there is no apparent need to bombard the user with ads, images and text, the page still has to have a nice-looking design with a few attractive features. The creative logo located right at the heart of the site is very appealing and you've got everything you need right at your fingertips: the searchbox and the language options. This is an example of how simple can also be effective!
